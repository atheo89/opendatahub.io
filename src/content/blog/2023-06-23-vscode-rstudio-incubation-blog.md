**Unlock powerful coding and data analysis capabilities in ODH 1.7**

Starting with ODH 1.7, we have started incubation of the Code Server and R Studio IDEs as part of the out of the box notebooks. This integration brings powerful coding and data analysis capabilities directly within the ODH ecosystem. To unlock these features, users are required to enable the additional overlay layer on the kfdef. 

Let's delve into the details of this new enhancement and how it can supercharge your ODH experience.

**Unleashing the power of coding using Code Server**  
Code Server is an open-source version of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) that allows you to run VS Code in a web browser. By incorporating Code-Server into ODH platform, we provide to the users familiar coding environment accessible from anywhere, promoting collaboration and convenience. Code-Server offers a plethora of features, including a rich code editor with syntax highlighting, IntelliSense for code completion, and debugging capabilities. Users can customize their workspace by installing extensions, themes, and keybindings, tailoring the IDE to their specific needs. Furthermore, Code-Server supports multiple programming languages, making it versatile for diverse development projects.

**Empowering data analysis with R Studio**  
For data scientists and statisticians, R Studio IDE is a go-to tool. It provides a powerful integrated development environment specifically designed for R programming. By integrating R Studio IDE into ODH, you equip data analysts with a dedicated environment for exploring and manipulating data, building models, and generating insightful visualizations. Moreover, If you are working with compute-intensive data science models that require GPU support, use the CUDA R Studio notebook image to gain access to the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit. 

Whether working on development projects or data science models, ODH 1.7 empowers users with a comprehensive platform that combines powerful IDEs with the ODH ecosystem's capabilities. Embrace the integration of Code Server and R Studio IDEs in ODH 1.7 and unlock the potential of coding and data analysis, taking your ODH experience to new heights.
